# Pickhacks2024
Ayman, Dheeraj, Merrick, and Maanav's submission for Pickhacks 2024!

## Inspiration
Most people in high crime and sketchy areas oftentimes feel unsafe about their solo walks. We wanted to bring forth an app that made people more secure about these walk home back from the work, club, friend's house, etc.

## What it does
Walk Secure provides an intuitive way to easily set your route home after a long night out. When something unfortunate happens to you and you steer off your path, your close contacts of family and friends will be automatically notified via text., On top of that, advanced AI security will detect your cries and struggles for help if someone harasses or violently acts on you.
